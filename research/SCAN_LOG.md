# SNAP manuscript scan log

Durable state for the 20-parent-scan review the user requested on 2026-09-16 at 19:45 EDT.
Rules carried through every scan. No agents. No workflows. No compute without asking first.
Every parent scan re-reads what the previous scan changed before it starts its own sub-scans.
Grades are honest and never inflated, and a scan that finds nothing says so.

## Ranking method

After each parent scan I record an honest ICLR-scale estimate. The scale is the ICLR reviewer
scale of 1 to 10, plus a rough acceptance probability. I hold the same rubric across scans so the
numbers are comparable, and I only move a number when a specific change justifies it.

Baseline before scan 1, carried from the independent reviewer pass earlier in this project.

| dimension | reading |
|---|---|
| soundness | strong, since every number traces to a stored result and the limitations are stated without hedging |
| novelty | moderate, since the estimator is an established split-half construction applied to a new unit |
| significance | moderate to strong for evaluation practice |
| clarity | the weakest axis, because the prose is dense and the appendix runs very long |
| honest overall estimate | 6.0, acceptance probability near 0.55 |

## Scan index

| scan | focus | defects found | defects fixed | rank after |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | mechanical correctness, all three tex files | 7 | 7 | 6.0 |


## Scan 1, mechanical correctness, 20 sub-scans

Sub-scans run. Compile warnings, punctuation, grammar agreement, banned punctuation, sentence floor,
number consistency between abstract and body, interval formatting, citation resolution, cross-reference
resolution, caption completeness, anonymity, page compliance, equation labelling, terminology drift,
tense, spelling variants, acronym first use, URL validity, duplicated sentences, and decimal style.

Defects found and fixed.

1. `main.tex` carried a comma splice, `than those without it, Sweeping 2,000 weightings`, now a full stop.
2. `fig:prediction` had a caption and no reference anywhere, which I introduced earlier today when I
   added the figure. The paired-uncertainty paragraph now points at it.
3. Four appendix tables, `tab:original5`, `tab:original12`, `tab:original14` and `tab:original15`, had
   labels that nothing referenced. Each now has a pointer in the paragraph that introduces it.
4. The two accuracy power figures, 0.111 from the compound-symmetric design run and 0.103 from the
   measured-matrix run, sat in different sections with nothing tying them. The appendix now states that
   they differ by 1.6 Monte Carlo standard errors.

One defect I created and caught inside the same scan. My first pointer for `tab:original5` landed inside
that table's own caption, producing a self-reference, and I reverted it before the build.

Non-defects recorded rather than edited.

- Mixed `\%` and the word percent. The paper-humanizer evidence base treats typographic inconsistency as
  a human trait and tells me not to normalise it, so I left it.
- Four equation labels that nothing references. A displayed equation discussed in the sentence beneath it
  needs no cross-reference, and adding four would cost main-text lines on a page-tight build.
- `centre` against `center` and one doubled-word hit were both false positives, from `\centering` and from
  the phrase `beats the plug-in in 0.81 of margin splits`.

Build after scan 1. Nine main-text pages, clean sentence gate, no overfull box anywhere in the log, no
unresolved citation, no unresolved reference, no unreferenced label outside the equation set.

Honest ranking after scan 1. Unchanged at 6.0 with acceptance near 0.55. Mechanical fixes remove one
reviewer complaint that a figure was never discussed, and none of them changes what the paper argues.
